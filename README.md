# OpenCV_Study
The main directory is part of the cv function I wrote with opencv C++(Personal project), 
and the 361_assignment subdirectory is the homework of my course (CMPT 361 Introduction to Computer Graphics (and Vision)) written in matlab.

## Compile and Run
Using MakeFile to Compile and Run, `make main` to Compile the OpenCV C++ file and `./main` to run them.
